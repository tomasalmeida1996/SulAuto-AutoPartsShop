Vehicle repair management and logistics software.


This store management software consists of a series of data manipulation operations that constitute not only the features normally associated with a customer, such as repairing faults, price of parts, and consulting client history, but also the operations typically associated with the administration of the workshop, such as stock replenishment, parts changes and the visualization of statistical data regarding the operation of the workshop.

The workshop contains a database (file peças.txt) with the registration of all existing products (parts) that make up the current stock, which are classified by Name (Nome), Price (Preço), ID and Sales profit (Lucro) (in percentage). There is also another file (Carros.txt), where the cars that can be repaired in this workshop are located, with the following format: Brand (Marca), Model(Modelo), Year (Ano). Finally, the file clientes.txt contains the client history data with the format: Firstname (PrimeiroNome), Lastname (UltimoNome), Age (Idade), IdNumber (Contribuinte).

To perform the client and administrator operations, a menu UI interface was developed.
